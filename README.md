# Android_DnD_app
My name is connor orvis as of september 2018 i am a senior in the SIU Computer Science program.
This is my first personal project and it is a DnD character creator, the goal of this project
is to simplify the process of making a DnD character as well as making the processes easier for people 
who are new to the game 

if you have any questions about this project you can email me at cporvis@siu.edu
